h1. What is this?

Pousse is a french game similar to tic-tac-toe, except ofcourse unlike it's simpler cousin it is not trivial. The game is played on an N byN board, here is one for 5 by 5 variant:

pre. .....
.....
.....
.....
.....


Two players move consecutively X and O by pushing one piece in from one of the four sides. There are 4xN possible moves at every step, here is how the board looks after the first "top 0" move:

pre. X....
.....
.....
.....
.....

Each inserted piece pushes older pieces aside in the inserting direction. Here is what happens after a "left 0" move:

pre. OX...
.....
.....
.....
.....

Empty squares absorb the push, for example after "right 0" move:

pre. OX..X
.....
.....
.....
.....

If there are no empty squares on the insertion column/row the piece at the opposing side will fall off the board. 

The game ends when one player accumulates more full lines of length N than the other, or when a board position repeats itself. Draw is not possible only Win or Loss. For example this game was won by X

pre. XOO..
XO.O.
XXOOO
XOXXO
XX..X


h1. Playing

For now use 

pre. $cake play

and enter moves on an interactive prompt. 

h1. To develop

First install nodeunit via

pre. $npm install nodeunit

then run the tests via 

pre. $cake test

To test if your change improved the AI strength spawn a server with the new changes and play it against a client of a base checkout.

pre. $cake server

pre. $cake client

Unless you hit some bugs, 1000 games tournament with swapping first mover will be played against the old version. Any AI improvments should be visible.
